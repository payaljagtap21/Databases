Oracle

First, you need to create a user, as schemas are associated with users in Oracle:

CREATE USER mydatabase IDENTIFIED BY mypassword;


Then, you need to grant the necessary privileges to the user:

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO mydatabase;

Key Differences

In MySQL, CREATE DATABASE directly creates a database.

In Oracle, creating a database involves setting up an instance and associated files, while creating a schema involves creating a user.

MySQL: The user creating the database typically needs CREATE privileges.

Oracle: Creating a user and granting privileges is a necessary step for schema setup.

MySQL: The process is straightforward and can be done in a single command.

Oracle: The process can be more involved and often requires additional configuration.

-- Create the user (which corresponds to a schema)
CREATE USER mydatabase IDENTIFIED BY mypassword;

-- Grant necessary privileges to the user
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO mydatabase;

Dropping an entire database involves more steps and typically requires shutting down the instance. Dropping a schema (user) can be done with a single command but requires the CASCADE option to remove all objects.

The DROP USER command with CASCADE is used to remove a schema and all its objects. Dropping an entire database instance is a more involved process.

First, connect as a privileged user (e.g., SYS or SYSTEM):

-- Drop the user and associated schema
DROP USER mydatabase CASCADE;

Oracle does not have a direct equivalent to the USE command. In Oracle, each connection is made to a specific database (or more precisely, to a specific instance of a database), and within that database, you can work with different schemas.

To switch contexts within Oracle, you typically need to reference the schema directly in your SQL commands or reconnect using a different user that corresponds to the desired schema. You can also alter the session to change the current schema:

ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA = myschema;

Schema context is typically handled through user connections and schema references.

Oracle does not have a SHOW DATABASES command since it operates differently from MySQL. Instead, Oracle uses a single database with multiple schemas. To list all schemas (users) in Oracle, you can query the ALL_USERS view:

SELECT USERNAME FROM ALL_USERS;

If you need to list all tablespaces (which are more akin to MySQL databases in terms of physical storage), you can query the DBA_TABLESPACES view (assuming you have the necessary privileges):

SELECT TABLESPACE_NAME FROM DBA_TABLESPACES;

No direct equivalent to SHOW DATABASES since Oracle's architecture differs from MySQL.

-- List all schemas (users)
SELECT USERNAME FROM ALL_USERS;

-- List all tablespaces
SELECT TABLESPACE_NAME FROM DBA_TABLESPACES;


CREATE TABLE users (
    id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Explanation:
CREATE TABLE users: Starts the statement to create a table named users.
id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY: Defines a column id of type NUMBER that is automatically generated as an identity (auto-incrementing) column and is the primary key of the table.
username VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL: Defines a column username that can store up to 50 characters and cannot be NULL.
email VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL: Defines a column email that can store up to 100 characters and cannot be NULL.
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP: Defines a column created_at of type TIMESTAMP with a default value of the current timestamp.

MySQL uses VARCHAR for variable-length character strings, while Oracle uses VARCHAR2.

MySQL uses INT for integers, while Oracle uses NUMBER.

Oracle uses TIMESTAMP for date and time values, which is also supported in MySQL.

In MySQL, AUTO_INCREMENT is used to auto-generate primary key values.

In Oracle, GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY is used for auto-incrementing columns.

INSERT INTO users (username, email, created_at)
VALUES ('john_doe', 'john_doe@example.com', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

 CURRENT_TIMESTAMP is an Oracle function that returns the current date and time.


SELECT * FROM users;

SELECT username, email FROM users;

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe';

Key Similarities
Basic Syntax: The basic structure of the SELECT statement is the same in both MySQL and Oracle.
WHERE Clause: Both databases support the WHERE clause for filtering rows based on specific conditions.
Aggregate Functions: Both databases support common aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc., for performing calculations on selected rows.

Key Differences
Date and Time Functions: Functions like NOW() in MySQL vs SYSDATE or CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in Oracle.
Syntax for String Operations: MySQL and Oracle might differ slightly in how they handle string operations and concatenation.
System Functions: There are differences in how some system functions or keywords are implemented, though the core SQL functionality remains largely consistent.
